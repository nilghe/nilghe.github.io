I implemented the systems to handle translations between Japanese and English, working in the front-end with reactjs and using Vagrant to handle our Django backend.

- title: Employee On-boarding Website
  order: 4
  desc: 
    - A client had an “out of the box” idea for a web site for their on-boarding process for employees. The result was a one page web app which displayed pages as “tiles” on the page and they shifted around the page to reveal other sections. Not only was this a design challenge code wise, but also a technical challenge in optimization to ensure all major browsers could handle the heavy page.

    - One year, instead of writing out Christmas cards by hand, I created a very simple web app to send digital greetings. Users redeem a code provided to them and a festive Christmas card is generated on screen for them. It's now been used for the past two years to hand out cards to friends and family.
